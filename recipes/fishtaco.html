    <h1>Grilled Fish Tacos with Chipotle-Lime Dressing</h1>
    <img src="./pictures/fishtaco.jpeg" alt="Fish Tacos">
    <p>I came up with this recipe when I couldn't find good directions for grilled fish tacos. I liked the chipotle-lime combination in a dip I once tried so I imitated it here. Choose toppings to suit your taste, or include typical accompaniments such as salsa fresca, cabbage, a squeeze of lime juice, and chopped cilantro.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div></div>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lime zest</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons honey</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon seafood seasoning, such as Old Bay™</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon hot pepper sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound tilapia fillets, cut into chunks</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the marinade, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, lime juice, lime zest, honey, garlic, cumin, chili powder, seafood seasoning, black pepper, and hot sauce in a bowl until blended. Place the tilapia in a shallow dish, and pour the marinade over the fish. Cover, and refrigerate 6 to 8 hours.</li>
        <li>To make the dressing, combine the sour cream and adobo sauce in a bowl. Stir in the lime juice, lime zest, cumin, chili powder, seafood seasoning. Add salt, and pepper in desired amounts. Cover, and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate. Set grate 4 inches from the heat.</li>
        <li>Remove fish from marinade, drain off any excess and discard marinade. Grill fish pieces until easily flaked with a fork, turning once, about 9 minutes.</li>
        <li>Assemble tacos by placing fish pieces in the center of tortillas with desired amounts of tomatoes, cilantro, and cabbage; drizzle with dressing. To serve, roll up tortillas around fillings, and garnish with lime wedges.</li>
    </ol>
